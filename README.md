# Twitter-Clone-Project
Build a Twitter Clone using HTML, CSS, CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid, JavaScript, and DOM.
We will start with HTML and CSS. After completing the following sections:

 i) HTML 

 ii) CSS 

 iii) CSS Flexbox

 iv) CSS Grid

We will build three different pages of Twitter - Main Page, Login Page and News Feed Page based on HTML and CSS. After that, comes:

 v) JavaScript 
 
 vi) DOM 

Once we are familiar with JavaScript and DOM, we will add some functionality to our project. We will create some validation in order to navigate between different pages, also, you will be able to build different modal boxes, sidebar and dark mode.

Finally, we will make our project fully responsive on different screen sizes, so, you'll be able to master the Responsive Web Design..!!

Thank You :)
